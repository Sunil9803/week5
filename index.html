      <p class="line1">Once I was seven years old, my mama told me</p>
      <p class="line2">"Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely"</p>
      <p class="line3">Once I was seven years old</p>
      <p class="line4">It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger</p>
      <p class="line5">Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker</p>
      <p class="line6">By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor</p>
      <p class="line7">Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure</p>
